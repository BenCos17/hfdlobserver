# Tandem
#
# This example sketches out the important parts of a configuration where there is more than one Web-888 device
# available. The `local_receivers` must all be specified, and separate `receivers` entries should exist for each
# different web-888 device. If they reference the base (builtin) `web888` receiver type, you can provide the common
# dumphfdl/decoder options in the `dumphfdl/default` configuration section and they'll be used for all.
#
# If you have any custom settings in your previous settings YAML, you can add them in. This is not necessarily a
# complete runnable example.
