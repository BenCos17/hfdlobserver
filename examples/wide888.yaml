# Wide888
#
# This example sketches out the important parts of a configuration where the Web-888 device is running a custom
# firmware to make larger channels available in a special configuration. This is not intended for beginners.
# Discussion about the custom firmware and its development take place in the HFDL channel of the airframes.io discord.
# The firmware itself can be found at https://github.com/rpatel3001/red-pitaya-notes/releases .
# The `local_receivers` must all be specified as they each require a unique port number. They reference an updated
# base `web888` receiver definition, which is amended with the couple of changes needed. Depending where you have
# installed the custom client, you will need to adjust the `recorder_path`. You can provide the common
# dumphfdl/decoder options in the `dumphfdl/default` configuration section and they'll be used for all.
#
# If you have any custom settings in your previous settings YAML, you can add them in. This is not necessarily a
# complete runnable example.
