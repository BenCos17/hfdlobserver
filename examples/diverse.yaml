      # The most complicated part of this. This defines the allowed sample rates for receivers using this configuration

      # rate can be used, or it can be a list itself as `[low, high]`. This covers the case where the receiver can
      # handle an arbitrary sample rate (within the range). The first example is for an RSPdx without over burdening
