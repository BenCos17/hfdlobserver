Web-888 can provide 13 streams of IQ data. HFDL Observer takes advantage of these to listen to as many useful HFDL frequencies as possible at any given time. In order to pick the right frequencies, you need to configure a prioritized list of station IDs.

You can either specify the list of IDs directly, or the installer can make a good(?) guess depending on the latitude and longitude of your Web-888 device.
