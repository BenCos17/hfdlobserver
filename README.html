    <h1>HFDL Observer</h1>
    <p>A multi-headed dumphfdl receiver for use with Web-888 devices.</p>
    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>The dynamism of the High Frequency Data Link infrastructure poses some problems for those trying to efficiently
        monitor these packets. There are a wide variety of frequencies in use across the HF spectrum (in this case,
        between 2.5 and 22MHz). The active frequencies change depending on time of day, ionospheric conditions, and the
        associated ground station. Picking the correct frequencies, and switching between them is a challenge. This
        challenge is magnified as many available SDRs have limited sample rates, and cannot scan the entire available
        HFDL frequency space.</p>
    <p>Enter <a href="https://www.rx-888.com/rx/">RX-888 (mk2)</a> and <a href="https://www.rx-888.com/web/">Web-888</a>
        devices. These are advanced, yet still affordable, SDRs that can process the entire HF spectrum at the same
        time. </p>
    <p>Unfortunately, the RX-888 (mk2) suffers from limited driver availability for Linux, which is a common platform
        for HFDL hobbyists. HFDL stations are frequently lower power devices such as odroids, raspberry pi and the like
        which may not have the CPU necessary to deal with the firehose of data from the RX-888 mk2.</p>
    <p>The Web-888 offers a solution for that. It combines the receiver of an RX-888 mk2 with an FPGA programmed to do
        bulk processing of data, and an KiwiSDR compatible web interface, based on <a
            href="https://github.com/jks-prv/Beagle_SDR_GPS">Beagle SDR</a> from which KiwiSDR is also derived. It
        offers 13 simultaneous streams/channels to process. Each channel is fairly narrow (12kHz) but that is enough to
        cover up to 4 HFDL frequencies (if they are close enough together).</p>
    <h2>Features</h2>
    <p>HFDL Observer makes using a Web-888 device to receive HFDL packets (and share them with airframes.io, or
        other consumers) easy.</p>
    <p>It assigns frequencies to each of 13 virtual "receivers". The assignments are based on a list of currently active
        frequencies ranked by a user-configured station preference (generally stations nearer your Web-888 should have
        higher preference).</p>
    <p>It manages the <code>kiwirecorder</code> web socket clients that stream the raw data from Web-888 for each
        virtual receiver. It also manages the <code>dumphfdl</code> processes used to decode HFDL from the raw I/Q data
        <code>kiwirecorder</code> emits.</p>
    <p>It watches the decoded HFDL packets for frequency updates. When the active frequency list changes, virtual
        receivers may be reassigned to higher-priority frequencies.</p>
    <p>Optionally, it can also retrieve updated frequency lists from community source (such as hfdl.observer or
        airframes.io). This covers periods where squitters (frequency updates) may not be received by your station for a
        time.</p>
    <p>In general, there are around 30 frequencies active globally at a given time. HFDL Observer allows your
        station to monitor (typically) 18-23 of them.</p>
    <p>Processing the entire HF frequency space would be very CPU-intensive. Taking advantage of the FPGA in Web-888 to
        select only the portions we're interested in means:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The data rate from the Web-888 to the device running HFDL Observer is around 5Mbps.</li>
        <li>The aggregate bandwidth that needs to be scanned by all virtual receivers is around 156kHz.</li>
        <li>The CPU required for the virtual receivers is about Â½ of 1 core of an Odroid M1S or Raspberry Pi4 (~13%
            total CPU)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>CUI</h2>
    <p>HFDL Observer also adds a simple but rich console-based display. At the top is a heat map like grid depicting
        the frequencies currently (or recently) being observed, and packet counts for each minute. Below that is log
        output. As it is console based, it can run within a <code>screen</code> session over <code>ssh</code> from a
        remote computer.</p>
    <p>This is a bit more CPU intensive, taking about the same CPU as all of the virtual receivers combined. It can be
        disabled, and is disabled by default when it is run as a (systemd) service.</p>
    <h2>Setting up the Web-888</h2>
    <p>To start, follow the <a href="https://www.rx-888.com/web/guide/requirements.html">basic set up instructions</a>
        on the Web-888 site. You'll need to put the ROM image on a micro-SD card. There's little activity and little use
        of space, so you should not go overboard on a card (in fact, don't use anything 32GB or larger, as the device
        will be unable to read it).</p>
    <p>You do not have to configure any of the "public" options -- you aren't going to be sharing this device to the
        public. You should make sure its location is configured correctly, though. This can be done automatically if
        you've attached a GPS antenna.</p>
    <p>There are only a few settings that are of interest.</p>
    <h3>Control Tab</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><code>HF Bandwidth Selection</code>: select 32M. Using 64M will disable 1 channel (leaving only 12).</li>
        <li><code>Disable waterfalls/spectrum?</code>: YES. No web clients will be using this device, and you can save a
            bit of processing power.</li>
        <li><code>Switch between HF or Air Band</code>: Select HF</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Config Tab</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><code>Enable ADC PGA?</code>: your choice. It's safe to try either for a period.</li>
        <li><code>Correct ADC clock by GPS PPS</code>: YES if you have a GPS antenna connected.</li>
        <li><code>Enable ADC Dithering</code>: NO. This does not help the I/Q processing dumphfdl does.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Public Tab</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><code>Register on www.rx-888.com/web/rx?</code>: NO. You're using this device exclusively for your own
            private use. Even if you need to access it over public Internet, you don't need it to register with the
            available public servers.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Installation</h2>
    <p>Installation can be performed on <code>apt</code>-equipped systems (Debian, Ubuntu, Armbian, etc.) by using the
        provided <code>install.sh</code> command. The installation requires <code>sudo</code> access so that it can
        install packages and dependencies.</p>
    <p><code>
$ git clone https://github.com/hfdl-observer/hfdlobserver888
$ cd hfdlobserver888
$ ./install.sh
</code></p>
    <p>Formal releases are not made at this time, so <code>main</code> off of the repository is the best source.
        Releases will come eventually.</p>
    <h3>Breakdown</h3>
    <p>The install script automates the following steps:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Installing necessary basic packages: <code>whiptail python3 python3-venv git</code></li>
        <li>Set up a virtual environment, and activate it.</li>
        <li>Install Python requirements (from <code>requirements.txt</code>) into the virtual environment using
            <code>pip</code>.</li>
        <li>Download <code>kiwiclient</code> to a known location.</li>
        <li>Install <code>dumphfdl</code> (and dependencies)
            <ol>
                <li>Install package dependencies:
                    <code>build-essential cmake pkg-config libglib2.0-dev libconfig++-dev libliquid-dev libfftw3-dev zlib1g-dev libxml2-dev libjansson-dev</code>
                </li>
                <li>clone <code>libacars</code>, build, and install it.</li>
                <li>clone <code>statsd-c-client</code>, build, and install it.</li>
                <li>clone <code>dumphfdl</code>, build, and install it.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Run <code>./configure.py</code> to walk through some simple configuration questions.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>While several helper programs are installed, they are invoked via the operating system, HFDL Observer makes
        no alteration to any of their code or operations, and connects only through standard mechanisms (file handles
        and sockets).</p>
    <h2>Configuration</h2>
    <p>Configuration is provided by a YAML formatted file. By default, and normally, it is <code>settings.yaml</code>.
    </p>
    <p>The provided <code>./configure.py</code> script asks a number of questions to provide basic configuration. For
        most users, this should suffice. The <code>src/settings.py</code> file contains a commented system default
        settings dialog for the curious, or those in need of more complex configurations. This is still in some flux,
        but the basic <code>settings.yaml</code> structure should be stable.</p>
    <p>You can rerun <code>configure.py</code> at any time, and it will walk you through the questions again; subsequent
        runs will write to <code>settings.yaml.new</code> so you can compare and merge the files if you desire.</p>
    <p>The configuration tool provides two options for setting the ranked order of HFDL stations.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>You can provide a comma-separated list of station IDs. You can see the station IDs and some related
                information at the <a href="https://hfdl.observer">HFDL.observer</a> site.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>The configuration tool can "guess" the station ranking. It builds this list using distance from your
                Web-888's location. You will have to enter it. Generally entering just the rounded degrees latitude and
                longitude should be sufficient.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>The distance tool is also available as</p>
    <p><code>
$ extras/guess_station_ranking.py &lt;lat&gt; &lt;lon&gt;
</code></p>
    <h2>Running</h2>
    <p>Once configured, you can run the receiver by</p>
    <p><code>
$ &lt;path-to&gt;/hfdlobserver888.sh
</code></p>
    <p>if you do not want the "fancy" TUI, pass in the <code>--headless</code> option. The usage is minimal, but is
        explained with <code>--help</code>.</p>
    <p>Hopefully, it should Just Work.</p>
    <p>In case of abnormal termination, you should kill any <code>kiwirecorder.py</code> instances that may be left
        hanging. This can be accomplished with the following:</p>
    <p><code>
$ pkill -f kiwirecorder
</code></p>
    <h2>Exiting</h2>
    <p>Press <code>^C</code> (control + C). Enhance your calm, as it can take a couple of seconds to shut down cleanly.
    </p>
    <h2>Run as a Service (very alpha)</h2>
    <p>If you want to run this as a service, you can run the script to install the service file for systemd.</p>
    <p><code>
$ extras/install-service.sh
</code></p>
    <p>It then becomes a normal service named <code>hfdlobserver888</code>. Following the usual pattern, there is a very
        minor ability to configure it via <code>/etc/default/hfdlobserver888</code>, but most items are managed through
        the <code>settings.yaml</code> file.</p>
    <h2>Implementation Notes</h2>
    <p>The internal structure of HFDL Observer is more complicated than it strictly needs to be. Much of this is
        derived from the desire to be fairly decoupled internall for future reuse. This project started as a less well
        defined desire to orchestrate a variety of different SDRs in sample HFDL frequencies, and it may be expanded to
        deal with less homogenous virtual receivers in the future. It should also abstract well to handling remote
        receivers, plus remote status and management (even later).</p>
